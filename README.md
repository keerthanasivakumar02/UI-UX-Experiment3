## Aim:
Evaluate the impact of design changes on user behaviour (for Both A and B) using A/B testing methods.
## Algorithm:
A (Control) → Original design (e.g., ChatGPT-style UI).

B (Variation) → New design (e.g., Gemini-style or merged hybrid UI).

Goal → Measure which design leads to better user behavior (engagement, clicks, conversions, retention).
